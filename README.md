# Note-Taker
This is a repo for taking notes. One can write and save notes using Express.js.

## Description

Managing your daily tasks can be daunting. Studies show that if you can organize yourself and plan your tasks out, your have a greater chance of completing your tasks on time. I started this project because I wanted to create an app that allows me to track my daily tasks and store that data locally. Making this daily planner app helps to keep those who use it on schedule and organized. While completing this project I strengthened my skillset with JQuery, Bootstrap, and deeping my understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
